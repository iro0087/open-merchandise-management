Merchandise program management

Allow to automatically actualize the stock of merchandise according to the sells and the delivery of each when running the program.

The sells are written on the "Sorties" sheet and the deliveries on the "Entr√©es" sheet, you can change the name, just make sure to also change
the string (corresponding to the sheet name) in the source code between line

The original features that provides this program is that it allows you to search for the volume of sells or deliveries done between two different date
not necerssarily knowing the date. In fact the program will take as a time interval the values that are the closest to the given one.
